Our speaker will be Kenneth Chen, Secretary General of the LegCo Secretariat. Kenneth will speak about the opportunities and challenges with Open Data for politics and legislation in Hong Kong.

With projects like “[Open LegCo](http://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/open-legco/)”, the Legislative Council attaches great importance to the promotion of openness and public access to information about the work of the Legislature.
